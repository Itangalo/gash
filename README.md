gash
====

gash (Google Apps Script helpers) contains a number of functions that hopefully
makes it easier to write Google scripts. For now, gash contains:

* A wrapper layer for property set/get, that allows storing and fetching
  objects -- not only stings.
* A mini framework for creating 'areas' in the UI, and for adding widgets to
  these areas.
* One pseudo UI widget, allowing file uploads to be managed without having to
  bother with form posts and the like.

Have a look at the examples file or the the gash script itself if you want to
try it out.

Note: This work is ongoing and kind of experimental. Suggestions and
improvements are very welcome.
